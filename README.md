# takBot

Use `!tak @opponent (optional 3-8 to set size)` to start a new game.

The challenged player gets to move first.

The bot tracks games through the last move in the channel and can only see 50 message back.

If you want to run multiple games at once, please use different channels.

Example commands:
```
!tak help
!tak @opponent
!tak @opponent <size>
!tak undo
!tak link
<while playing, any valid ply on it's own line>
```
